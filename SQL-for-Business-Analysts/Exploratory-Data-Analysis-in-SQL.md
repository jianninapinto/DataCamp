</> Count missing values

Which column of fortune500 has the most missing values? To find out, you'll need to check each column individually, although here we'll check just three.

- First, figure out how many rows are in fortune500 by counting them.

```sql
-- Select the count of the number of rows
SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM fortune500;
```

- Subtract the count of the non-NULL ticker values from the total number of rows; alias the difference as missing.

```sql
-- Select the count of ticker, 
-- subtract from the total number of rows, 
-- and alias as missing
SELECT count(*) - COUNT(ticker) AS missing
  FROM fortune500;
```

Answer: We have 32 missing values on the ticker column.

- Repeat for the profits_change column.

```sql
-- Select the count of profits_change, 
-- subtract from total number of rows, and alias as missing
SELECT COUNT(*) - COUNT(profits_change) AS missing
FROM fortune500;
```
